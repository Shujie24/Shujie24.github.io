About Me
======
Hi! My name is Shujie Deng, I am a master student in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at UC Berkeley. Previously, I completed my Honours Bachelor of Science at the University of Toronto, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with a focus on Artificial Intelligence.

Previously, I was honoured to be supervised by Professor [Xujie Si](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~six/) and worked as a research assistant at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I also worked as a machine learning engineer intern at [Tealbook](https://www.tealbook.com/).

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on machine learning evaluation, specifically how to design and measure machine learning systems accurately and thoroughly. I am also broadly interested in alignment, reasoning of language models and enhancing capabilities of AI agents.

Current Research
======
I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the FHL Vive Center for Enhanced Reality at UC Berkeley, supervised by Allen Yang. My research involves:

- Developing end-to-end on-device LLM applications using Qualcomm AI Hub
- Experimenting with model distillation techniques to integrate open-source LLMs like Llama into Android applications
- Building responsive frontend interfaces with speech-to-text capabilities for enhanced accessibility
- Enabling robot actions through natural language processing

Previous Experience
======
I have worked as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Tealbook, where I constructed and optimized backend attribute supplier classifiers using BERT, GPT, XGBoost, and RoBERTa for over 5 million supplier companies, achieving a 9% average accuracy improvement. I also served as a Machine Learning Research Assistant at the Vector Institute, where I led projects benchmarking Large Language Models' logical reasoning abilities and built pipelines integrating LLMs with z3 solvers using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

Technical Skills
======
- **Languages**: Python (Proficient), C/C++, Java, SQL (PostgreSQL), R
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, NLTK, CUDA, AutoGen, LangChain, Hugging Face, NumPy
- **Cloud & Tools**: Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery, Airflow), Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Unix/Linux, Bash
- **Software**: React, Postman, Agile Development methodologies

Publications
======
My work on "Enhancing and Evaluating Logical Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models" was presented at the ICLR 2024 Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Large Language Models, where we improved accuracy across multiple reasoning datasets including ProofWriter (16.7%), LogicalDeduction (8.7%), FOLIO (5.5%), and ProntoQA (0.4%).

Contact
======
I'm always interested in discussing research opportunities, collaborations, or interesting problems in machine learning and AI. Feel free to reach out via email at [shujie.deng@berkeley.edu](mailto:shujie.deng@berkeley.edu) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/shujiedeng/).
