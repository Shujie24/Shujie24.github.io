## Project Overview
Research project at FHL Vive Center for Enhanced Reality, UC Berkeley, focused on developing end-to-end on-device LLM applications using Qualcomm AI Hub.

## Key Contributions
- **Model Distillation**: Experimented with model distillation techniques to integrate open-source LLMs like Llama into Android applications
- **Edge Computing**: Developed on-device LLM applications for enhanced privacy and reduced latency
- **UI/UX Integration**: Collaborated with UI/UX team to integrate responsive frontend with speech-to-text capabilities
- **Robot Control**: Enabled robot actions through natural language processing

## Technologies Used
- Qualcomm AI Hub
- Llama (open-source LLM)
- Kotlin (Android development)
- Speech-to-text APIs
- Model distillation techniques
