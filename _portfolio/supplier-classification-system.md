## Project Overview
Machine Learning Engineer Internship project at Tealbook focused on constructing and optimizing backend attribute supplier classifiers for over 5 million supplier companies.

## Key Contributions
- **Model Development**: Constructed, fine-tuned and optimized backend attribute supplier classifiers using BERT, GPT, XGBoost, LightGBM and RoBERTa
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieved 9% average accuracy improvement across all classifiers
- **API Integration**: Experimented with OpenAI APIs and Cohere API with few-shot learning
- **Data Pipeline**: Integrated with SerpAPI to improve supplier data quality using Dataflow and Airflow in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Validation Pipeline**: Designed metrics with BERTScore and F1 score to compare semantic similarity for regression models

## Technologies Used
- BERT, GPT, RoBERTa, XGBoost, LightGBM
- OpenAI APIs, Cohere API, SerpAPI
- Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery, Airflow, Dataflow)
- CI/CD pipeline
- BERTScore, F1 score metrics
